        <p id="overview-header">Overview</p>
        <p id="overview1"><strong>Slit Lamp Simulator</strong> is a virtual version of a slit lamp, a critical diagnostic tool used by ophthalmologists, to give medical students hands-on practice in a virtual environment. Because physical slit lamps are often in use and hard to access, this simulation lets students train more often and with more flexibility.</p>
        <p id="overview2">During this development cycle, the goal was to create a strong <strong>minimum viable product (MVP)</strong> to demonstrate the concept’s potential and secure additional funding. The simulation was developed in <strong>Unity</strong> for the <strong>Meta Quest headset</strong> at the <strong>University of Miami’s Virtual Experience and Simulation Lab (VESL)</strong>—an XR innovation hub for students and faculty-led projects.</p>
        <p id="overview3">The project was led by <strong>Dr. Giselle Ricur</strong>, an ophthalmologist and digital health specialist at the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute. I joined the project as a <strong>Developer</strong>, and was responsible for building and polishing features according to the Primary Investigator (PI)’s vision and user feedback.</p>

        <p id="features-header" class="spacer">Key Features</p>
        <ul id="features1" class="spacer">
            <li>Integrated a 3D model of a <strong>slit lamp</strong> with accurate proportions and controls</li>
            <li>Designed an immersive <strong>examination room</strong> environment</li>
            <li>Added a <strong>virtual patient model</strong> for realistic interaction</li>
            <li>Enabled customization of <strong>room lighting, table, and chair height</strong> to accommodate users of varying statures</li>
            <li>Developed a functional <strong>examination light</strong> with color filters and adjustable size/intensity</li>
            <li>Simulated real-world <strong>lamp movement and adjustment</strong> for accurate hands-on practice</li>
            <li>Built a <strong>virtual camera system</strong> with zoom capabilities, plus a video screen for viewing</li>
            <li>Implemented <strong>hover states</strong> and highlighting for all interactive elements to improve usability and onboarding</li>
        </ul>

        <p id="iterations-header" class="spacer">Iterations</p>
        <p id="iterations1" class="spacer">We held regular working sessions with Dr. Ricur, who frequently tested the simulation and provided detailed feedback from her clinical experience. Her input led to iterative refinements including:</p>
        <ul id="iterations2">
            <li>Adjusting object positions to match real-world ergonomics</li>
            <li>Calibrating the zoom function to better reflect actual slit lamp optics</li>
            <li>Improving UI/UX based on feedback from VR beginners and users unfamiliar with ophthalmology tools</li>
        </ul>
        <p id="iterations3">The MVP was showcased at <strong>eMerge 2024,</strong> where attendees provided valuable feedback—especially for those new to VR or slit lamp usage. Their insights helped ensure the simulator remains intuitive and accessible for first-time users, such as medical students.</p>

        <p id="future-header" class="spacer">Future Development</p>
        <p id="future1" class="spacer">With the MVP now complete, the next team plans to:</p>
        <ul id="future2">
            <li>Integrate <strong>educational modules,</strong> including simulated eye conditions</li>
            <li>Conduct <strong>formal testing</strong> with real ophthalmology students to evaluate learning outcomes and further refine the simulator</li>
        </ul>

        <p id="takeaways-header" class="spacer">Takeaways</p>
        <p id="takeaways1" class="spacer">The execution of this project pushed me to think critically, work collaboratively, and bring an ambitious idea to life through hands-on problem-solving and innovation. Some skills I pushed throught the process include:</p>
        <ul id="takeaways2">
            <li><strong>VR Development:</strong> Gained a deeper understanding of developing immersive VR experiences through the Unity XR Interaction Toolkit.</li>
            <li><strong>Team Collaboration:</strong> Collaborated closely another developer, working in a shared code repository with emphasis on clean documentation, tight version control, and consistent communication.</li>
            <li><strong>User-Centered Design:</strong> Designed with a focus on clarity, comfort, and usability thanks to PI and user feedback—especially for non-technical users.</li>
        </ul>
