                <p>
                    &emsp;Welcome to my site! I am an aspiring Extended Reality(XR), Web, and Game Developer. 
                    My goal is to create fun, interactive experiences thorugh the power of innovative technology.
                    Interactivity allows experiences to become more engaging, allowing stories to be told on a 
                    deeper level, learning to become easier and more hands-on, or just making a once tedious task less so.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &emsp;My passion for interactive experiences stems from my background of creating things as a child, 
                    and my current experience at the University of Miami working towards a degree in Interactive Media and 
                    Computer Science.
                </p>

                    <p>XR is the most immersive medium we have available, and is inherently interactive. It allows us to do the impossible, the dangerous, the things we could never afford.</p>

                    <p>The internet is everywhere and a part of our daily lives. Making the web more interactive allows for better, more interesting, and more personal experiences for everyone.</p>

                    <p>Gaming has been on the rise for decades. They don't have to be just for entertainment; you can socialize and make friends or learn something new through them as well.</p>
