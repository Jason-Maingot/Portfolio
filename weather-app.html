            <h2 class="title_caption">A Flutter App Experiment Using Real-time data</h2>

            <h2 class="bolded">Overview & Role</h2>
            <p>
                &emsp;This project is a mobile weather application built using the Dart programming language and the Flutter framework. The primary objective was to deepen my understanding of Flutter, particularly features I was less familiar with—such as streaming live data from the web and managing state across multiple Flutter “pages.”
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;I served as the sole developer and designer on this project, overseeing all aspects of development, UI design, and implementation.

            <h2 class="bolded">Web API Integration & Design Process</h2>
            <p>
                &emsp;This was my first time integrating a web API to stream live data into a mobile application. I chose to create a weather app inspired by the default weather apps found on most smartphones. I utilized the National Weather Service (NWS) public API, which provides real-time weather data for various U.S. locations near major weather stations.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;While the API offered key data points—like temperature, wind speed, precipitation, and brief condition descriptions—it lacked the detailed insights available in more advanced weather apps. To address this, I designed wireframes that balanced simplicity and usability, taking inspiration from existing weather apps while working within the constraints of Flutter's layout system.
            </p>

            <p class="image-caption">A wireframe sketch used to desing the app</p>
            <p>
                &emsp;Integrating the API and displaying the data cleanly proved to be a technical challenge. I leaned heavily on the official Dart and Flutter documentation, as well as community examples, to resolve bugs and ensure the data rendered accurately and efficiently.
            </p>

            <h2 class="bolded">Final Deliverable</h2>
            <p>
                &emsp;Once the core functionality was stable, I focused on visual design and user experience. I selected a blue-dominant color palette, associating it with the sky and common weather visuals. To enhance the interface:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>I added atmospheric background images</li>
                <li>Applied rounded corners and transparency to content boxes</li>
                <li>Adjusted typography and spacing to improve readability and visual balance</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                &emsp;The result was a clean, responsive, and informative weather app with a polished front-end experience.

            <h2 class="bolded">Next Steps</h2>
            <p>
                &emsp;This project was primarily a personal learning exercise, but it opened up opportunities for future improvement. Possible next steps include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Consolidating content into a single scrollable view for better UX</li>
                <li>Leveraging Flutter’s cross-platform capabilities to deploy the app on both Android and iOS, as well as web</li>
                <li>Expanding the use of APIs to include more detailed weather insights or additional user features</li>
            </ul>
