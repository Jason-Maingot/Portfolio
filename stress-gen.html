            <!-- Section 1 - Overview -->
             <h2 class="bolded">Overview</h2>
             <p>
                &emsp;<span class="bolded">Stress Generator</span> is a virtual reality simulation developed in collaboration with the <span class="bolded">University of Miami’s Virtual Experience and Simulation Lab (VESL)</span> and <span class="bolded">Dr. Firdaus Dhabhar</span>, a tenured professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Director of the Laboratory of Stress and Resilience in Health and Healing.
             </p>
             <p>
               &emsp;The goal of this project is to simulate a precarious rope bridge crossing, allowing researchers to trigger and study participant stress responses using the <span class="bolded">HP Omnicept headset</span>. The system outputs biometric data and researcher annotations for later analysis.
             </p>

            <!-- Section 2 - Role -->
             <h2 class="bolded">My Role: Project Lead & Lead Developer</h2>
             <p>
                &emsp;I joined the project as the <span class="bolded">Project Lead and primary developer</span>, taking over from a previous group of student developers. My responsibilities included:
             </p>
             <ul>
                <li>Planning and managing development sprints</li>
                <li>Organizing regular check-ins with the PI</li>
                <li>Refactoring and upgrading core systems</li>
                <li>Implementing new features and improving existing functionality</li>
                <li>Ensuring the simulation was polished and stable for researcher use</li>
             </ul>

             <!-- Section 3 - Revamps -->
             <h2 class="bolded">Revamping the Environment and Researcher UI</h2>
             <div class="double-picture">
               <img src="assets/stress-gen/OldCanyon.PNG" alt="">
               <img src="assets/stress-gen/NewCanyonTop.PNG" alt="">
             </div>
             <p class="image-caption">A comparison of the old environment (left), and the new environment (right).</p>

             <p>
                The first phase of my work focused on two major areas:
             </p>
             <p>
                <span class="bolded">1. Participant Environment:</span><br>
                &emsp;The original bridge environment was too short, visually unconvincing, and lacked depth perception. Based on feedback from the PI, I:
             </p>
             <ul>
                <li>Redesigned the canyon to be <span class="bolded">wider and deeper</span>, improving its psychological impact</li>
                <li>Introduced a more <span class="bolded">natural, less arid environment</span> with a river, boulders, and foliage to enhance immersion</li>
                <li>Added <span class="bolded">spatial audio</span> for realism and depth</li>
                <li>Balanced visual perspective to amplify height perception</li>
             </ul>
             <p>
                <span class="bolded">2. Researcher Interface:</span><br>
                &emsp;A Figma-based design was provided to modernize the researcher UI. I:
             </p>
             <ul>
                <li>Recreated the UI in <span class="bolded">Unity</span> with full interactivity</li>
                <li>Integrated <span class="bolded">biometric data display</span> and note-taking functionality</li>
                <li>Ensured researcher annotations are saved alongside the simulation data for analysis</li>
             </ul>

             <p class="image-caption">A picture of the full design for the UI on Figam</p>

             <!-- Section 4 Environmental Controls -->
             <h2 class="bolded">Advanced Environmental Controls</h2>
             <p>To allow researchers greater control over participant experience, I implemented a suite of dynamic environmental tools, including:</p>
             <ul>
                <li><span class="bolded">Time of day: </span>Toggle between day and night</li>
                <li><span class="bolded">Weather effects: </span> Switch between clear and rainy conditions</li>
                <li><span class="bolded">Fog and wind levels: </span>Adjustable in real-time</li>
                <li><span class="bolded">Dynamic canyon depth: </span>Alter perceived height mid-simulation</li>
                <li><span class="bolded">Bridge Instability: </span>Trigger falling rocks and breaking planks for heightened tension</li>
             </ul>
             <p>
                &emsp;I also iterated on a feature where researchers could break bridge planks mid-crossing, introducing surprise elements to amplify stress. One major technical challenge involved ensuring Unity’s XR Toolkit properly synced physics between the participant and moving bridge elements, especially under strong wind forces.
             </p>

             <!-- Section 5 - Mobility -->
             <h2 class="bolded">Enhancing Participant Mobility</h2>
             <p>
                &emsp;Originally, movement across the bridge was joystick-based. Based on a new requirement from the PI, I added support for <span class="bolded">real-world physical locomotion</span> using the HP Omnicept controllers as trackers. 
             </p>
             <p>
               This involved:
             </p>
             <ul>
                <li><span class="bolded">Researching motion tracking options</span> compatible with the Omnicept</li>
                <li>Reworking the movement system to accommodate <span class="bolded">step-based locomotion</span></li>
                <li>Allowing researchers to select between <span class="bolded">joystick and physical movement modes</span></li>
             </ul>

             <!-- Section 6 - Handoff -->
             <h2 class="bolded">Project Handoff & Future Development</h2>
             <p>
                &emsp;I stepped away from the project during my final semester to focus on job searching and portfolio development. Before leaving, I:
             </p>
             <ul>
                <li>Created thorough technical documentation</li>
                <li>Onboarded a new developer to ensure a smooth handoff</li>
                <li>Provided guidance on remaining features and upcoming testing</li>
             </ul>
             <p>
                &emsp;Next steps for the team include finalizing mobility features, conducting user testing, and collecting stress-response data.
             </p>

             <!-- Section 7 - Lessons -->
             <h2 class="bolded">Lessons Learned</h2>
             <p>
                &emsp;This project was a significant milestone in my development journey. As my first experience leading a project, I gained hands-on experience in:
             </p>
             <ul>
                <li>Project management and team coordination</li>
                <li>VR simulation design and 3D spatial reasoning</li>
                <li>Navigating the intricacies of real-time physics in XR environments</li>
                <li>Communicating with stakeholders across research and technical disciplines</li>
             </ul>
