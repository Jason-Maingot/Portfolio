            <h1>Return to Manufacturer — Game/Music Jam 2021 Submission</h1>
            <h2 class="bolded">Overview & Role</h2>
            <p>
                Return to Manufacturer was Team Retrograde’s submission for Game/Music Jam 2021—an event where developers had 48 hours to create a game based on a given prompt, followed by musicians having 48 hours to compose a soundtrack for it.
                <br>I served as the <span class="bolded">lead developer and programmer</span> for the project. In addition to implementing core systems, I contributed extensively to gameplay and systems design. The rest of our four-person team included specialists in level design, art, and general game design.
                <br>The event’s prompt was <span class="bolded">“Return”</span>, which inspired the game’s theme and mechanics. We created a gameplay loop centered around retrieving and delivering packages, featuring a unique forward-and-backward dash ability and a boomerang as the player’s main weapon—both literal interpretations of the prompt.
            </p>
            <h2 class="bolded">Team Collaboration & Time Management</h2>
            <p>
                The greatest challenge was the strict 48-hour time limit—and starting from scratch with a team of mostly strangers. We began by introducing ourselves, outlining individual skill sets, and assigning roles. I was chosen to lead development due to my familiarity with programming and game engines. We decided to use Unity for its flexibility and my prior experience with it.
                We spent the first few hours scoping out ideas and setting realistic goals. From there, we worked continuously while staying in a persistent voice call to ensure quick communication and tight feedback loops. I frequently worked with the designer to scale back or adjust features in order to meet the deadline without sacrificing quality.
            </p>
            <h2 class="bolded">What I Learned</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="bolded">Time management</span> under pressure and how to prioritize essential tasks</li>
                <li><span class="bolded">Communicating technical limitations</span> clearly to non-technical teammates</li>
                <li><span class="bolded">Rapid learning and problem-solving</span>—I had to quickly pick up Unity's animation system</li>
                <li>Gained experience with <span class="bolded">game and level design</span>, both in giving feedback and contributing ideas</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="bolded">Next Steps</h2>
            <p>
                After the jam, we published the game on itch.io. While the team doesn’t plan to continue development on this version, we’ve discussed possibly collaborating again—this time without a time limit, using Return to Manufacturer as creative inspiration.
