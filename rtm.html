        <p id="overview-header">Overview</p>
        <p id="overview1"><strong>Return to Manufacturer</strong> was built as a result of Game/Music Jam 2021—a 48-hour event where developers and musicians collaborate to create a fully functional game paired with an original soundtrack.</p>
        <p id="overview2">I served as <strong>lead developer and programmer,</strong> implementing the game's core systems and contributing heavily to gameplay and systems design. Our four-person team also included specialists in level design, art, and overall game design.</p>
        <p id="overview3">The event’s prompt, <strong>"Return,"</strong> directly shaped our theme and mechanics. We designed a gameplay loop centered around retrieving and delivering packages, with a unique forward-and-backward dash mechanic and a boomerang as the primary weapon—both literal twists on the idea of return.</p>

        <p id="takeaways-header" class="spacer">Takeaways</p>
        <p id="takeaways1" class="spacer">The biggest challenge was the strict 48-hour time limit—plus starting from scratch with a team of mostly strangers. After outlining our skills and assigning roles, I was chosen to lead development based on my programming and engine experience. We picked Unity for its flexibility and my familiarity with the platform.</p>
        <p id="takeaways2">We quickly scoped ideas, set realistic goals, and stayed in constant communication through a nonstop live working session, keeping decision-making and feedback fast and efficient. Throughout the project, I worked closely with the designer to adjust and scale features, making sure we hit the deadline without sacrificing quality. Key learnings include:</p>
        <ul id="takeaways3">
            <li><strong>Managing time</strong> under extreme pressure and prioritizing essential tasks</li>
            <li><strong>Communicating technical limitations clearly to non-technical teammates</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Rapid learning and problem-solving,</strong> including quickly mastering Unity’s animation system</li>
            <li>Building hands-on experience with <strong>game and level design,</strong> from contributing ideas to giving actionable feedback</li>
        </ul>
